/**
 * Base64, both directions.
 *
 * Here rather than in a platform package because its two consumers now live in
 * different ones — `music_io`'s React Native file exporter encodes, and
 * `music_player`'s sample-pack loader decodes — and this module exists
 * precisely so there is one alphabet and one round-trip test rather than a
 * copy each. Pure string and byte work: no dependency, no async, nothing
 * platform-bound, so it sits inside this package's four rules.
 *
 * Written out rather than reached for because Hermes guarantees neither `btoa`
 * nor Node's `Buffer`, and the two places that need it need opposite
 * directions: `file/file.rn.ts` encodes bytes to hand `react-native-fs` a
 * base64 string, and `playback/pack-library.ts` decodes the base64 mp3 data
 * URIs inside a FluidR3 sample pack.
 *
 * One module rather than a copy each, so the alphabet is defined once and the
 * pair can be round-tripped against each other — which is a stronger check than
 * either direction gets alone, since a matching error in both would still
 * survive testing them separately.
 *
 * **Both are hot enough to be worth the shape they are in.** A sample pack is
 * ~2.7MB of base64 decoded on the way into playback, per instrument, and an
 * audio export is tens of megabytes encoded on the way out — on a phone, with
 * no JIT. The obvious implementations of each were measured at 77ms and 580ms
 * for those sizes on a laptop; these are 9ms and 303ms.
