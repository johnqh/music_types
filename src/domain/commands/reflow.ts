 *   real chord and all survive; same-pitch duplicates at that span are
 *   deduped down to the last one (see `dedupeSamePitch`) rather than kept
 *   as "overlapping."
 * - Between genuinely different spans that overlap, **last-in-array
 *   wins**: every command in this module that inserts/moves/resizes a
 *   note builds its voice's event list as `[...existingNotes, editedOrNewNote]`,
 *   so "last" always means "the note this edit just touched." The
 *   winning note keeps its full span; whatever it overlaps is trimmed
 *   down to its own remaining (non-overlapping) piece, or dropped
 *   entirely if fully covered. If trimming would leave a note with two
 *   disjoint remaining pieces (a higher-priority note punched a hole in
 *   its middle), only the longer piece survives — a note can't be split
 *   into two fragments by this step (Task 3's `splitNoteAcrossMeasures`
 *   is the tool for genuine multi-segment splitting, at measure
 *   boundaries; mid-note deletion-by-overlap is a deliberately simpler,
 *   documented edge case here).
 *
 * This is "replace-on-overlap" by design: it's what lets a piano-roll
 * drag/insert land a new note and have it take precedence over whatever
 * it's dropped onto, matching common DAW behavior, while still keeping
 * `reflowVoice`'s output well-formed (no silently-overlapping, no
