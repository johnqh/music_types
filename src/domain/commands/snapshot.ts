/**
 * Generic `ScoreCommand` builders backed by Immer patches (Task 5 brief).
 * `snapshotCommand` records, at each `execute` call, the forward/inverse
 * patches between the score it's given and the result of running `mutate`
 * over an Immer draft of it; `undo` replays the inverse patches. Because
 * Immer's patches are derived mechanically from the actual before/after
 * trees, `execute` then `undo` is guaranteed to reproduce a deep-equal
 * score for *any* `mutate`, however structurally involved — command
 * factories don't need to hand-write inverse logic.
 *
 * `execute` is re-run (recomputing patches against whatever score it's
 * given) every time it's called, so a command replayed via
 * `HistoryManager.redo` after an intervening `undo` still produces correct
 * patches for a subsequent `undo`, as long as `undo` is always called with
 * the exact score `execute` most recently returned (the standard linear
 * undo-stack contract `HistoryManager` relies on).
