/**
 * The words an edit is described in, as a contract the host fills in.
 *
 * An edit has to be *named* — in the undo history and in the occasional toast
 * — and no library in this family holds user-facing strings in any language.
 * So music_editing declares what it needs to say as keys and facts, and each
 * app supplies the sentences (`setEditingCopy`, built by music_lib's
 * `createLibraryCopy`). The contract is declared here so the library that
 * reads it and the one that builds it name one shape.
 */

/**
 * One key per command, named for the command rather than its wording.
 *
 * An array with the type read off it, not a bare union: a host has to prove
 * every one of these has a translation, and a union has no runtime form to
 * walk. Both apps' undo histories printed raw keys for labels nobody had
 * written — the web for eleven commands, the native app for all but four —
 * because nothing could enumerate what was needed.
