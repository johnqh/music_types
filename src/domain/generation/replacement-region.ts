/**
 * What a Replace action will overwrite.
 *
 * Three scopes, one shape. The important one is `notes`: its range is the
 * selected notes' exact tick span and is deliberately NOT snapped out to
 * measure boundaries, which is what every other regeneration path does
 * (`selectionToRange`, and through it `prepareRegenerationRequest`, always
 * align). A caller that snaps this has changed the feature into Replace
 * Measures.
 *
 * A non-contiguous selection is reported as its bounding span, so notes the
 * user did not select can fall inside it. `unselectedNoteCount` exists so the
 * UI can say so before anything is replaced, rather than leaving it to be
 * discovered afterwards.
