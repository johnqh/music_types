 * The headings the style picker groups its entries under.

 * every table that implements a style — genre rules, song forms, lyric
 * patterns, the style pages — stays keyed by that style. A family inherits
 * nothing and passes nothing down: the rules that were generalised across
 * styles are the ones recorded as punishing correct music, so a family is
 * where a reader looks for a style, not what the style is made of.
 *
 * Not the same grouping as music_api's `FAMILY_OF_GENRE`, which groups styles
 * by the song FORM they share — reggae and waltz both take the 64-bar song
 * template, and nobody looks for them under one heading.
 *
 * Declared as an array with the type read off it, so a family can be listed
 * and validated at runtime; each one's words are the hosts', by key.
