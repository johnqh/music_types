/**
 * The drawing vocabulary the instrument icons are authored in: a tiny,
 * renderer-neutral shape list plus a parser for the path subset it allows.
 *
 * Two consumers draw the same art through different APIs — the canvas track
 * gutter (`stroke-icon.ts`) and the app's `<svg>` component — so the art itself
 * cannot be expressed in either one's terms. SVG path data is the natural
 * authoring format, but handing it to canvas would mean `Path2D`, which jsdom
 * does not implement; the gutter's drawing would then be untestable in the unit
 * suite. Parsing the subset ourselves keeps one authored source and keeps both
 * renderers testable.
 *
 * The subset is deliberately small: absolute `M`/`L`/`C`/`Q`/`Z` and explicit
 * circles. No arcs (their SVG parameterisation is endpoint-based and converting
 * it to canvas's centre-based `arc` is exactly the fiddly, bug-prone code this
 * design avoids) and no relative commands (an icon is authored once and read
 * many times; absolute coordinates stay readable). Anything else throws, so a
 * malformed icon fails in the test suite rather than drawing silently wrong.
