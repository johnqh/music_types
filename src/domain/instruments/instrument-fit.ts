/**
 * Moving a track's music into a new instrument's compass.
 *
 * Changing the instrument on a track that already has notes is not just a
 * relabelling: a bass line handed to a piccolo sits entirely below what a
 * piccolo can play, and the result is a part that renders but cannot sound.
 * So the notes come with it — shifted by whole **octaves** where that is
 * enough, because an octave keeps the pitch class and a bassline still reads
 * as that bassline. Only when no octave shift fits does it fall back to the
 * smallest chromatic shift that does.
 *
 * A part wider than the instrument's own compass cannot be fitted at all, and
 * that answer is returned rather than approximated — the caller decides what
 * to say about it. Nothing here knows any user-facing words.
