/**
 * The General MIDI catalogue, shaped for a picker.
 *
 * Every caller that offers "which instrument?" — a generate dialog, a track
 * property sheet — needs the same three things: the flattened list of melodic
 * programs grouped by family, the eight drum kits, and a way to turn whichever
 * one was chosen back into the fields a `Track` stores. Deriving those at each
 * call site is how the two lists get confused, so they are derived once here.
 *
 * Kits are tagged rather than numbered, because a kit's program means
 * something else entirely from a melodic one: on channel 10, program 8 is the
 * Room Kit, not Celesta. That is what `KIT_PREFIX` is for, and why a bare
 * program number must never be handed to a control offering `KIT_OPTIONS` —
 * it matches nothing and the control renders empty while still selecting
 * correctly, which is a bug that looks like a styling problem.
 *
 * No user-facing copy lives here beyond the GM names themselves, which are
 * fixed identifiers rather than translatable strings — "Acoustic Grand Piano"
 * is the program's name in every locale.
