/**
 * Instrument lookups that take a **track**, not a program number.
 *
 * `Track.midiProgram` means one of two different things depending on the
 * track's clef: a General MIDI instrument on a pitched track, a drum kit on a
 * percussion one. Every table in this folder is keyed by program, so reading
 * one without knowing the clef silently answers for the wrong thing — and the
 * wrong answers were not obviously wrong, which is why they shipped:
 *
 * - Brush is kit 40, and program 40 is Violin, so `gmMaxPolyphony` capped a
 *   drum track at two simultaneous notes and the toolbar refused a three-piece
 *   crash-snare-kick hit.
 * - Electronic and TR-808 are kits 24 and 25, and programs 24-25 are guitars,
 *   which are written an octave above where they sound — so in written mode a
 *   TR-808 part was drawn an octave off the staff position for its own drums.
 * - Every kit is some melodic instrument's range, so the on-screen keyboard
 *   offered keys that could not sound a drum and hid the ones that could.
 *
 * These wrappers are the single place that distinction is encoded. Call them
 * instead of the program-keyed tables anywhere a `Track` is in hand.
