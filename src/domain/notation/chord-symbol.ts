/**
 * Splitting a chord symbol into the parts MusicXML wants.
 *
 * The model stores the symbol as typed, because a lead sheet's vocabulary is
 * wide and inconsistent and nothing a player writes should be refused. But
 * MusicXML's `<harmony>` wants a `<root-step>` and an `<alter>` — so the root
 * has to come out of the string for export, and only the root.
 *
 * The rest is carried verbatim as the kind's display text with `kind="other"`.
 * That is a deliberate refusal to guess: mapping `-7`, `min7`, `m7`, `mi7` and
 * `−7` onto MusicXML's enumeration is a dictionary that is wrong for somebody,
 * and a symbol that round-trips as the exact text it was typed as is worth
 * more here than one classified into a taxonomy. A reader that understands
 * only the enumeration still sees the right root and the right printed text.
