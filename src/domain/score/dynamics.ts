/**
 * What a dynamic marking does to the sound.
 *
 * A dynamic is stored on the note it starts at and is in force until the next
 * one on that track — the way it is read on paper. Resolving that into a
 * velocity per note is what makes the marking audible rather than decorative,
 * and it happens in `flattenScoreNotes`, the single traversal both live
 * playback and offline export already share, so the two cannot disagree about
 * how loud a passage is.
 *
 * **The note's own velocity survives.** A dynamic sets the level; the velocity
 * written on a note is kept as its deviation from the default, so an accent
 * inside a quiet passage stays an accent. The three rules that follow from it:
 *
 * - a score with no dynamics plays exactly as it did before they existed;
 * - a note left at the default under `ff` plays at `ff`;
 * - a note written louder than default under `ff` plays louder still.
 *
 * The alternative — a dynamic overwriting velocity outright, which is what
 * most notation software does — would have made the inspector's Velocity field
 * silently inert the moment a passage was marked, which is worse than either
 * behaviour on its own.

 * The velocity each note in a hairpin ramps to.
 *
 * A dynamic sets a level; a hairpin is the *change* between two of them, so
 * the only honest way to sound one is to ramp. The span runs from the note
 * carrying `hairpinStart` to the one carrying `hairpinStop`, and velocity
 * moves linearly from the level in force at the opening to the level in force
 * just **after** the close — which is how a player reads it: the wedge takes
 * you to the next marking.
 *
 * **Where there is no next marking**, the wedge still has to arrive somewhere.
 * A crescendo with nothing after it goes one dynamic step up from where it
 * started, and a diminuendo one step down. That is what a player does with an
 * unresolved hairpin, and it beats the alternatives: leaving it flat makes the
 * marking silent, and ramping to full or to nothing turns an unmarked detail
 * into the loudest or quietest thing in the piece.
