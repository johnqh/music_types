/**
 * Making a fermata audible, as a local slowing rather than a longer note.
 *
 * A pause holds a note and delays everything after it. The obvious model —
 * stretch the note and shift the rest — is the wrong one here, because the
 * score tick *is* the playback tick: the caret, the following-scroll, "play
 * from here" and the position scrubber all rest on that identity, and moving
 * notes in time would break every one of them.
 *
 * A tempo dip changes none of it. The notes keep their written ticks; the
 * ticks simply take longer to elapse across the held note, which is what a
 * fermata means to a player anyway — the beat stretches, the notation does
 * not. **And it is the reason the caret needed no work at all**: it
 * dead-reckons between position reports through a `TempoMap`, so a map that
 * slows down slows the caret down with it. Building the caret's map from
 * anything else would make it glide past the pause and snap back, which is
 * exactly the class of bug its interpolation exists to avoid.
 *
 * So this is the single derivation, and `playbackPlan`, `renderEvents` and the
 * caret all read it. Live playback, the exported audio file and the thing on
 * screen therefore cannot disagree about how long a pause lasts.
 *
 * A score with no fermata returns its own `tempoMap` array **unchanged, by
 * identity**, so nothing about an unmarked score's playback is even
 * recomputed.
