/**
 * Flattening a score into the notes that actually sound.
 *
 * One traversal, shared by live playback (`playbackPlan`) and offline audio
 * export (`renderEvents`). They used to walk the score separately, and drifted:
 * playback joined tied notes into one sustained note while the export
 * re-articulated every tied segment — so a tie sounded once on screen and
 * twice in the file, against `renderEvents`' own promise to match "what you
 * just heard".
 *
 * Ticks, not seconds: a tempo is the caller's concern. Live playback keeps
 * ticks and hands the engine a `TempoConversion`; the offline renderer
 * converts, because a rendered file has no tempo map to consult.
 *
 * Mute and solo are *not* applied here either. The export drops silenced
 * tracks' notes, while playback keeps them and lets the engine mix live — the
 * whole reason `applyMix` exists.
