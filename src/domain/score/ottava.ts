/**
 * The octave brackets, as a display lens.
 *
 * `8va` means "these notes were written an octave lower to keep them on the
 * stave — play them where the bracket says". The model stores **sounding**
 * pitch, so the bracket is what moves the noteheads, not the sound: this walks
 * a score and shifts every note inside a span to where it should be *drawn*.
 *
 * A lens over the whole score rather than a shift inside the renderer, for the
 * reason `writtenScore` is one: the layout and everything measured from it see
 * the same score, so the drawn note and its staff position agree by
 * construction rather than by two matched calculations.
 *
 * Returns the **identical object** when no bracket exists, so `computeLayout`'s
 * identity cache is untouched by a score that has none — which is almost every
 * score.
 *
 * **Known limitation**, shared with `writtenScore`: clicking to place a note
 * *inside* a bracket writes the drawn pitch as the sounding one, because note
 * entry has no inverse for the display lens. That gap predates this and is not
 * specific to ottava.
