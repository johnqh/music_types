/**
 * Translating between where the music *is written* and where it is *played*.
 *
 * Without repeats these are the same number, and the whole editor was built on
 * that: the caret is a score tick, `seek` takes a score tick, the
 * following-scroll finds a bar from one. Expanding a repeat breaks the
 * identity — bar 3 played twice has two performance positions and one written
 * position — so rather than teach four separate consumers about repeats, the
 * plan carries this timeline and they translate through it.
 *
 * A score with no repeats produces an identity timeline: one segment covering
 * everything, `performanceTick === sourceTick`. That is what keeps every
 * existing behaviour byte-identical.
