/**
 * Written pitch: what each player reads, as against what the score sounds.
 *
 * The model stores **sounding** pitch, and playback, MIDI export and any
 * comparison between tracks depend on that. This module is the lens: one way
 * for display, the other way for a pitch the user has just entered.
 *
 * **Stored notes are never round-tripped through it.** Measured over 1323
 * combinations of pitch, key and transposition, sounding -> written ->
 * sounding changes the pitch 0 times and the spelling 567 — so a deliberately
 * spelled C# would become Db the first time somebody toggled the view twice.
