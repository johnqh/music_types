 * The selection as one editable chord, or `null` when it is not exactly one.

 * A chord is notes sharing a start tick in one voice. A selection spanning

 * rather than editing something arbitrary. That the rule fits in a sentence is
 * the point: it has to be explainable in the UI.
 *
 * Voice, not just track: two voices on one stave routinely sound together, and
 * treating a melody note and the bass note underneath it as one chord would
 * let a key press edit a line the player was not looking at.
