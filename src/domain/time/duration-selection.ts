/**
 * What the duration selector shows, given the selection.
 *
 * One control replaced six toggle buttons, and it has to answer a different
 * question depending on what is selected:
 *
 * - **nothing selected** — the length the *next* note will be written at, which
 *   is the store's `snapGrid`. The control is an instruction about the future.
 * - **one note selected** — that note's length. The control is a readout.
 * - **several, all the same length** — that length; they agree, so there is an
 *   answer.
 * - **several of different lengths** — no single answer, so `mixed`. Not the
 *   first note's length, and not the armed length: either would claim the
 *   selection is something it is not, and picking that same value from the menu
 *   would then look like a no-op while silently rewriting every other note.
 *
 * Picking a value always applies to every selected note *and* arms it for the
 * next one, so the control never has to explain which of its two jobs it is
 * doing. Kept pure and separate from the toolbar so the four cases can be
 * tested without rendering one.
