/**
 * Finding the tuplets already written in a voice.
 *
 * A triplet is not a separate kind of object in this model — it is three notes
 * whose durations are each two thirds of a plain note value, which is exactly
 * what a triplet *is*. The toolbar has been able to write them since the
 * duration table gained `triplet-*`; what was missing was drawing the bracket
 * and the number, and saying so in MusicXML.
 *
 * Derived rather than stored, deliberately. A `tupletId` on each note would be
 * a second source of truth that every edit — delete one of the three, change
 * one's duration, paste over the middle — could leave inconsistent with the
 * durations themselves. Deriving it means a group that no longer sums to a
 * plain note value simply stops being drawn as one, which is the truth.
