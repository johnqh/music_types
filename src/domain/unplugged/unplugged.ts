 * both are decisions this product made, not facts about music. Shared by
 * both apps so the two Unplugged tabs cannot compute a different volume for
 * the same arrangement.

 * `Score.unplugged` is absent until a reader first drags something, and
 * `effectiveUnpluggedArrangement` fills in a default half-circle position
 * for the listener and for any track — placed or not, old or newly added —
 * that has none. A caller never needs to check whether the arrangement
 * exists before asking where something is.
