/**
 * @sudobility/music_types — types and Zod schemas for the Moosiac music family.
 *
 * Single sectioned entry point (sudojo_types convention):
 *   1. Score model types (spec §4 of the Moosiac spec)
 *   2. Type guards
 *   3. Selection / fragment types
 *   4. Zod schemas for the score tree
 *   5. AI generation contracts (requests, results, provider interface)
 *   6. Zod schemas for the generation contracts
 *   7. Project API types (music_api payloads)
 *   8. Zod schemas for the project API
 *   9. Response envelope + error codes
 *
 * Contains the types and schemas, plus the pure domain primitives both sides
 * of the system need: pitch and tick math, the score factory, quantization,
 * ties and voice allocation.
 *
 * Those primitives used to live in `@sudobility/music_lib`, which put them out
 * of reach of the backend — `music_api` must never depend on `music_lib`, and
 * neither may depend on the other. Anything both sides need lives here or in
 * `@sudobility/music_codecs`; `music_lib` keeps what is frontend-only (store,
 * commands, rendering, playback).
