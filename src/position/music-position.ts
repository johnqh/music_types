/**
 * The one place that knows where playback is.
 *
 * **The first stateful singleton service in music_types, and deliberately so.**
 * This package is otherwise model and primitives. The playhead earns the
 * exception because it has exactly one writer — `@sudobility/music_player` —
 * and readers in every other package: the caret, the note highlighting and the
 * piano keyboard. Any other home creates a dependency edge that exists only to
 * reach it. It still obeys the four rules this package keeps: it works on both
 * the frontend and the backend, adds no dependency, contains no hooks and
 * contains no async code.
 *
 * Implements `IMusicPosition` — see that interface for why this exists at all.
 * The short version: the caret, the note highlighting and the piano keyboard
 * used to derive the playhead three different ways and drifted apart under
 * load. Now they read one number.
 *
 * **The smoothing lives here, not in the caret.** That is the load-bearing
 * decision. The engine reports position about thirty times a second, and those
 * reports arrive in clumps because they come off the audio scheduler's
 * lookahead loop rather than a wall clock — driving anything straight off them
 * leaves it stalled on most frames and jumping when it does move. So the
 * playhead is dead-reckoned forward from the last report, and because that
 * happens *inside the single source of truth*, every consumer that asks gets
 * the same smoothed answer at the same instant. When the caret did its own
 * dead-reckoning, it was smoothing a number nobody else was smoothing.
 *
 * The anchor is the engine's own clock reading, not `performance.now()` at the
 * moment the report was handled. Anchoring on receipt folds event-loop latency
 * into the playhead: under load the anchor is stamped late and everything
 * derived from it lags the audio, which is exactly the drift this replaces.
