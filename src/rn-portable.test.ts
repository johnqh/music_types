/**
 * music_types must run unchanged on the web and in React Native.
 *
 * The family's frontend packages are audited for this, and an audit is a
 * moment in time — one `document.` in a commit six months from now breaks a
 * native build at runtime, long after the change that caused it and nowhere
 * near it. So the property is checked here instead of remembered.
 *
 * Scoped to what SHIPS. Test files and test helpers are excluded because they
 * do not go in the package — music_codecs' test-only XML parser uses
 * `DOMParser`, which is exactly right for a helper that runs on a dev machine
 * and exactly wrong to flag as a portability defect.
 *
 * Comments and string bodies are stripped before matching, because prose about
 * a "document" is not a reach for the browser global, and a guard that cries
 * wolf is a guard somebody deletes.
